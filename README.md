- Uses custom link generation to produce download links using API from [StoreLib](https://github.com/StoreDev/StoreLib) and [MS-Store-API](https://github.com/ThomasPe/MS-Store-API)
- Uses [concurrent/multi-part downloader](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/93642/how-do-download-accelerators-work) using [pypdl](https://github.com/mjishnu/pypdl) for fast downloading

- Automatically use a new url in case current one expires
- Downloads and install app along with all dependencies 

# How it works

- The app open an browser which allows the user to select the file(application/games) they want to install and returns its url
- The url is parsed and the product key is obtained then, using Microsoft-Display-Catalog-API categoryid and file name is retrived 
- Using these data the app can send a request to Microsoft-Delivery-Optimization-service-API and retrive data of the selected application, this data is further parsed based on 
    - System architecture of the user(x64/x32)
    - Favorable type(these are decrypted file formats, which doesn't need admin privilage to install)
    - Latest version
- Then it retrives the download links for the parsed data using the API and the files are downloaded using [pypdl](https://github.com/mjishnu/pypdl), which allows for concurrent/multi-part downloading this makes the download faster.It also has the ability to resume interrupted downloads and can also automatically use a new url in case current download link expires.
- Finally it installs the downloaded files via Subprocess module

# FAQ

- How to Solve Failed to install Dependencies ?

    In some cases, this occurs since the dependencies are already installed on your pc. So check wheather the program is installed from start menu.
    if the program is still not installed, then there are 2 ways to solve this. **[only try the 2nd method if 1st method failed]**
    1. Enable Ignore Version (Options --> Advanced --> Dependencies --> Ignore Version), this will download all version of dependencies available for your system
    2. Enable Ignore All Filters (Options --> Advanced --> Dependencies --> Ignore All Filters), this will download all available dependencies (can take time)
